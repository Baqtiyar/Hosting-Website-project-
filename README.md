# Let's Host a Website using Amazon S3

Hosting: hosting is something which makes digital content accessible online, helps users to view website or use application from all around the world. For example when you search www.amazon.com on your web browser it automatically directs you to amazon website, this means that you are accessing the website data without knowing it. We store our website/application data into a server and use a hosting service to host it's content meaning making it available on Internet.
