# Let's Host a Website using Amazon S3

Hosting: hosting is something which makes digital content accessible online, and helps users to view websites or use applications from all around the world. For example, when you search www.amazon.com on your web browser it automatically directs you to the Amazon website, this means that you are accessing the website data without knowing it. We store our website/application data on a server and use a hosting service to host its content meaning making it available on the Internet. 

There are two types of Hosting 
1. Static hosting - In this hosting content remains the same until changed manually, The files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images) are stored on a server and delivered as-is to the client, without any server-side processing. For example: portfolios, landing pages, and informational sites.
2. Dynamic hosting - In this hosting content changes on user interaction, content is often retrieved from the database or generated through server-side scripts (Python). For example: social media platforms, e-commerce sites, or blogs.
